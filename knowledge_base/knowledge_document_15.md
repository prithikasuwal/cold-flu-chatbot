Nova Scotia Monthly COVID-19 Epidemiologic Summary: 
12JUL2022 
 
Public Health Branch 
Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Highlights: 
 
• 
A total of 7,570 PCR positive results, 144 hospitalizations and 15 deaths from COVID-19 were observed during the month 
of June 2022.  
 
• 
The number of PCR positive results,; hospitalizations, and deaths has decreased in June compared to the previous month, 
including for those in long-term care facilities. 
 
• 
Of the 15 deaths that occurred in June, 13 (87%) were in people aged 70 years and older and seven (47%) were residing in 
a long-term care facility.  
 
• 
Age and lack of vaccination continue to be associated with severe outcomes:  
 
• 
Nova Scotians aged 70+ have been hospitalized at nearly 13 times the rate of those 18-49 years of age and the 
rate of death is 161 higher compared to those under 50 years of age.  
 
• 
Unvaccinated Nova Scotians were hospitalized at nearly four times the rate and died more than three times the 
rate as those with three or more doses.  
 
• 
To more accurately estimate vaccine coverage in Nova Scotia, the province is switching from using Statistics Canada 
population estimates to the number of Nova Scotians eligible for MSI (the province’s health insurance card) as the 
denominator for estimating both per capita rates and vaccine coverage.

COVID-19 Cases  
Figure 1: Number and seven-day moving average of PCR positive results by 
collection date, March 1 to June 30, 2022 (N=61,790) 
 
Data source: Provincial Public Health Lab Network 
Notes:  
- 
PCR refers to polymerase chain reaction tests performed in a lab 
- 
Only the first positive result for the same individual within a 90-day period are counted; subsequent positive 
results will constitute a new infection (i.e., a re-infection).  
- 
Access to PCR tests are restricted to eligible populations as outlined in the following link:

Comparisons are made by dividing the age-specific rates in the age category of interest to the age-specific

- 
A person is considered unvaccinated when they have zero doses of any COVID-19 vaccine 
- 
A person is considered to have two doses 14 or more days after the second dose of any vaccine OR 14 or 
more days after one dose of Johnson & Johnson vaccine OR are within 14 days of receiving a third dose of 
any COVID-19 vaccine 
- 
A person is considered to have three or more doses 14 or more days after a third dose of any COVID-19 
vaccine 
- 
Due to small number of events occurring among those just one dose, that group is not included in this 
analysis. 
- 
To more accurately estimate vaccine coverage in Nova Scotia, the province is switching from using 
Statistics Canada population estimates to the number of Nova Scotians eligible for MSI (the province’s
