Nova Scotia Weekly COVID-19 Epidemiologic Summary: 
03 May 2022 
 
 
Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health  
Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness 
 
 
Highlights: 
 
• 
An additional 3,415 PCR positive results, 77 hospitalizations and 22 deaths from COVID-19 
were reported during the seven-day period ending May 2. The number of hospitalizations and 
deaths due to COVID-19 was lower this week than last.  
 
• 
The number of PCR positive results peaked in early- to mid-April and continues to decline. The 
data also suggest that the number of cases linked to long-term care and residential care 
facility outbreaks and the number of hospitalizations appears to have stabilized in the past 
two weeks. 
 
• 
Age continues to be associated with severe outcomes:  
 
• 
The risk of hospitalization is approximately 10 times higher for those aged 70 years 
and older compared to those 18 to 49 years old. 
 
• 
The risk of death is approximately 95 times higher for those aged 70 years and older 
compared to those younger than 50. 
 
• 
Vaccination continues to offer protection against severe outcomes. 
• 
Those who received 3 or more doses of COVID-19 vaccine had an 84.5% lower risk of 
hospitalization and a 92.9% lower risk of death than those who were unvaccinated or 
had only one dose.  
• 
The proportion of people with confirmed COVID-19 infections who are hospitalized, or die 
continues to be relatively low during the Omicron waves compared to earlier waves. Since 
March 1, 2022 (Wave 6 to date), 1.2% of cases were hospitalized and 0.2% of cases have died. 
 
• 
The total number of COVID-19 cases in residents of long-term care facilities is higher in the 
Omicron waves than in previous waves, and there have been more than double the number of 
cases in wave 6 compared to wave 5. However, the proportion of cases in long-term care 
facilities who die remains relatively low in the Omicron waves particularly compared to the 
first wave.

collection date, Feb 15 to May 3, 2022 (N=47,067) 
 
 
 
Data source: Provincial Public Health Lab Network 
Notes:  
- 
Laboratory tests are also referred to as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests 
- 
The previous 3 days presented in the red area should be interpreted with caution. PCR positive results during 
this timeframe may rise as labs continue to be processed 
- 
Access to PCR tests are restricted to eligible populations as outlined in the following link: 
https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirustesting. 
- 
Eligibility has changed over time. Before February 24, 2022 confirmatory PCR testing for people who tested 
positive on a rapid test was not available.

linked to open long-term care and residential care facility outbreaks, Feb 15 to 
May 3, 2022 (N=2400) 
 
 
 
Data source: Panorama 
Notes: 
- 
Only open (ongoing) confirmed outbreaks are included 
- 
A confirmed outbreak is defined as two or more lab-confirmed cases in residents and/or staff within a 14-
day period AND an epidemiological link between cases AND at least one reported case could have acquired 
the infection in the facility 
- 
Only facilities that are designated as long-term care congregate settings are included; it excludes residential 
care facilities and disability support program facilities with 12 or fewer residents 
- 
Includes confirmed and probable cases entered into Panorama and linked to the outbreak 
- 
Episode date is recorded as the date of symptom onset. If that information is unavailable, the following is 
used (in hierarchical order): specimen collection date, lab result date clinical diagnosis date  
- 
The five-day period presented in the red area should be interpreted with caution. Case counts during this 
timeframe may rise as individuals are identified and tested; as tests are processed; as data is inputted into 
Panorama
