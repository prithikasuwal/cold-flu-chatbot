Nova Scotia Weekly COVID-19 Epidemiologic Summary: 
10 May 2022 
 
 
Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health  
Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness 
Highlights: 
 
• 
An additional 3,118 PCR positive results, 65 hospitalizations and 18 deaths from COVID-19 
were reported during the seven-day period ending May 9.  
 
• 
The number of hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19 was lower this week than last, 
and the number of lab-confirmed cases, which peaked in early- to mid-April, continues to 
decline. The data also suggest that the number of cases linked to long-term care and 
residential care facility outbreaks, hospitalizations and deaths are on a downward trend. 
These declines suggest we are passed the peak of Wave 6. 
 
• 
Age continues to be associated with severe outcomes:  
 
• 
The risk of hospitalization is approximately 10 times higher for those aged 70 years 
and older compared to those 18 to 49 years old. 
 
• 
The risk of death is approximately 102 times higher for those aged 70 years and older 
compared to those younger than 50. 
 
• 
Staying up to date with vaccinations – that is, getting all the doses available for your age 
group and health status, including boosters -- offers significant protection against severe 
outcomes. 
• 
Those who received 3 or more doses of COVID-19 vaccine had an 84.6% lower risk of 
hospitalization and a 92.8% lower risk of death than those who were unvaccinated or 
had only one dose.  
• 
When adjusted for age, people with only two doses of vaccine have twice the rate of 
death than those with three or more doses. Those unvaccinated or without only one 
dose have over 13 times the rate of death compared to those with three or more 
doses. 
• 
The proportion of people with confirmed COVID-19 infections who are hospitalized or die 
continues to be relatively low during the Omicron waves compared to earlier waves. Since 
March 1, 2022 (Wave 6 to date), 1.3% of cases were hospitalized and 0.2% of cases have died. 
 
• 
The total number of COVID-19 cases in residents of long-term care facilities is higher in the 
Omicron waves than in previous waves with more than twice as many cases in Wave 6 than 
were reported in Wave 5. However, the overall fatality rate remains relatively low in the 
Omicron waves, particularly compared to the first wave.

collection date, Feb 15 to May 10, 2022 (N=50,575) 
 
Data source: Provincial Public Health Lab Network 
Notes:  
- 
Laboratory tests are also referred to as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests 
- 
The previous 3 days presented in the red area should be interpreted with caution. PCR positive results during 
this timeframe may rise as labs continue to be processed 
- 
Access to PCR tests is restricted to eligible populations as outlined in the following link: 
https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirustesting. 
- 
Eligibility has changed over time. Before February 24, 2022 confirmatory PCR testing for people who tested 
positive on a rapid test was not available.

linked to open long-term care and residential care facility outbreaks, Feb 15 to 
May 10, 2022 (N=2600) 
 
 
Data source: Panorama 
Notes: 
- 
Only open (ongoing) confirmed outbreaks are included 
- 
A confirmed outbreak is defined as two or more lab-confirmed cases in residents and/or staff within a 14-
day period AND an epidemiological link between cases AND at least one reported case could have acquired 
the infection in the facility 
- 
Only facilities that are designated as long-term care congregate settings are included; it excludes residential 
care facilities and disability support program facilities with 12 or fewer residents 
- 
Includes confirmed and probable cases entered into Panorama and linked to the outbreak 
- 
Episode date is recorded as the date of symptom onset. If that information is unavailable, the following is 
used (in hierarchical order): specimen collection date, lab result date clinical diagnosis date  
- 
The five-day period presented in the red area should be interpreted with caution. Case counts during this 
timeframe may rise as individuals are identified and tested; as tests are processed; as data is inputted into 
Panorama
