Nova Scotia Weekly COVID-19 Epidemiologic Summary: 
12 April 2022, 17:00 
 
Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health 
Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness 
Highlights: 
 
• 
This week’s reporting period is six days long and runs from Wednesday, April 6 to Monday, 
April 11. Future reports will capture data from Tuesday to Monday.  
 
• 
An additional 6,912 PCR positive results, 14 deaths, and 72 hospitalizations were reported in 
the six-day period ending April 11.  
 
• 
The number of PCR positive cases has continued to increase since March, as has the number 
of cases linked to long-term care and residential care facility outbreaks. 
 
• 
There was an increase in the number of hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19 this 
reporting period compared to last week. However, the percentage of COVID-19 cases who are 
hospitalized or die remains lower in Wave 5 compared to previous waves, particularly Wave 1 
when vaccines were not yet available.  
 
• 
For Wave 5, the case fatality rate among long-term care residents (2.5%) has been 
substantially lower compared to all other waves, particularly the first wave (21.7%). 
 
• 
Individuals aged 65 years or older continue to have the highest rates of hospitalization and 
death.  
 
• 
Vaccination continues to significantly reduce the risk of hospitalization and death.

*Notes: 
- 
Current week is based on 6 days rather than previous week which is based on 7 days 
- 
Laboratory tests are also referred to as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests

collection date (N=64,941)* 
 
 
 
Data source: Provincial Public Health Lab Network 
*Notes:  
- 
Laboratory tests are also referred to as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests 
- 
The previous 3 days presented in the red area should be interpreted with caution. PCR positive results during 
this timeframe may rise as labs continue to be processed 
- 
Due to a change in how rapid antigen positive confirmatory tests are being captured in the laboratory data, it 
is no longer possible to report these results separately. 
- 
Two changes to PCR eligibility were made during Wave 5:  
o 
On December 27, 2021, PCR testing was limited to certain priority groups, including those at 
highest risk of severe disease, people living in long-term care, and health-care workers (outlined as 
groups 1-3 in the following link: https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirustesting).  
o 
On February 24, 2022, PCR testing eligibility was expanded to include confirmatory testing for 
anyone who tested positive on a rapid test (group 4 in the link above).

Figure 2: Number of COVID-19 cases and seven-day moving average of cases 
linked to open long-term care and residential care facility outbreaks (N=1,224) 
 
 
 
Data source: Panorama 
*Notes: 
- 
Only open (ongoing) confirmed outbreaks are included 
- 
A confirmed outbreak is defined as two or more lab-confirmed cases in residents and/or staff within a 14-
day period AND an epidemiological link between cases AND at least one reported case could have acquired 
the infection in the facility 
- 
Only facilities that are designated as long-term care congregate settings are included; it excludes residential 
care facilities and disability support program facilities with 12 or fewer residents 
- 
Includes confirmed and probable cases entered into Panorama and linked to the outbreak 
- 
Episode date is recorded as the date of symptom onset. If that information is unavailable, the following is 
used (in hierarchical order): specimen collection date, lab result date clinical diagnosis date  
- 
The five-day period presented in the red area should be interpreted with caution. Case counts during this 
timeframe may rise as individuals are identified and tested; as tests are processed; as data is inputted into 
Panorama
