Nova Scotia Weekly COVID-19 Epidemiologic Summary: 
19 April 2022 
 
Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health 
Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness 
Highlights: 
 
 
• 
Comparisons between this week’s report and last week’s report should be interpreted with this 
caveat: this report covers a 7-day period, and the previous report covered a 6-day period. 
 
• 
An additional 7,508 PCR positive results, 84 hospitalizations and 13 deaths were reported this 
week (April 12- April 18). 
 
• 
The number of PCR positive results have shown an increasing trend since March, as has the 
number of cases linked to long-term and residential care facility outbreaks; however, the data 
suggests these trends may have stabilized.  
 
• 
The number of PCR positive tests does not represent a true case count in the province and is 
likely an underestimate. While confirmatory PCR testing following a rapid test positive is 
available, it is not a requirement. 
 
• 
The number of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 this week was similar to last week after 
considering the difference in reporting periods (7 vs. 6 days). The number of deaths was 
slightly lower. 
 
• 
Individuals aged 65 years and older have an 8 times greater rate of hospitalization and 55 
times greater rate of death than those aged 18 to 49 years. 
 
• 
Vaccination continues to significantly reduce the risk of hospitalization and death. People who 
have received three doses of a vaccine had an 82.5 per cent lower risk of hospitalization and 
90.7 per cent lower risk of death than people who have not been vaccinated or only received 
one dose.  
 
• 
The rate of severe outcomes (hospitalization and death) is lower in Wave 5 compared to 
previous waves, particularly the first wave when vaccines were not available. Omicron has 
been the dominant variant in the wave 5. 
 
• 
For Wave 5, the case fatality rate (% who died) among long-term care residents (2.4 per cent) 
has been substantially lower compared to all other waves, particularly the first wave (21.7 per 
cent).

collection date (N=72449) 
 
 
 
Data source: Provincial Public Health Lab Network 
*Notes:  
- 
Laboratory tests are also referred to as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests 
- 
The previous 3 days presented in the red area should be interpreted with caution. PCR positive results during 
this timeframe may rise as labs continue to be processed 
- 
Due to a change in how rapid antigen positive confirmatory tests are being captured in the laboratory data, it 
is no longer possible to report these results separately. 
- 
Two changes to PCR eligibility were made during Wave 5:  
o 
On December 27, 2021, PCR testing was limited to certain priority groups, including those at 
highest risk of severe disease, people living in long-term care, and health-care workers (outlined in 
the following link: https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirustesting).  
o 
On February 24, 2022, PCR testing eligibility was expanded to include confirmatory testing for 
anyone who tested positive on a rapid test.

Figure 2. Number of COVID-19 cases and seven-day moving average of cases 
linked to open long-term care and residential care facility outbreaks (N=1,426) 
 
 
 
Data source: Panorama 
*Notes: 
- 
Only open (ongoing) confirmed outbreaks are included 
- 
A confirmed outbreak is defined as two or more lab-confirmed cases in residents and/or staff within a 14-
day period AND an epidemiological link between cases AND at least one reported case could have acquired 
the infection in the facility 
- 
Only facilities that are designated as long-term care congregate settings are included; it excludes residential 
care facilities and disability support program facilities with 12 or fewer residents 
- 
Includes confirmed and probable cases entered into Panorama and linked to the outbreak 
- 
Episode date is recorded as the date of symptom onset. If that information is unavailable, the following is 
used (in hierarchical order): specimen collection date, lab result date clinical diagnosis date  
- 
The five-day period presented in the red area should be interpreted with caution. Case counts during this 
timeframe may rise as individuals are identified and tested; as tests are processed; as data is inputted into 
Panorama
