Nova Scotia Monthly COVID-19 Epidemiologic Summary: 
09AUG2022 
Public Health Branch 
Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Highlights: 
 
• 
A total of 8,650 PCR positive results, 225 hospitalizations and 9 deaths from COVID-19 were observed during the month of 
July 2022.  
 
• 
The number of PCR positive results, and hospitalizations increased in July compared to June whereas the number of 
deaths decreased. 
 
• 
Of the nine deaths that occurred in July, six (67%) were in people aged 70 years and older and three (33%) were residing in 
a long-term care facility.  
 
• 
Age and lack of vaccination continue to be associated with severe outcomes:  
 
• 
Nova Scotians aged 70+ have been hospitalized at nearly 14 times the rate of those 18-49 years of age and the 
rate of death is 166 times higher compared to those under 50 years of age.  
 
• 
Unvaccinated Nova Scotians were hospitalized at nearly four times the rate and died more than three times the 
rate as those with three or more doses.

COVID-19 Cases  
Figure 1: Number and seven-day moving average of PCR positive results by 
collection date, March 1 to July 31, 2022 (N=70,440) 
 
Data source: PPHLN 
Notes:  
- 
Laboratory tests are also referred to as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests 
- 
The previous 3 days should be interpreted with caution. PCR positive results during this timeframe may rise 
as labs continue to be processed 
- 
Access to PCR tests are restricted to eligible populations as outlined in the following link:

Note:  
- 
Care-in-place: All patients are treated in the unit or facility of the hospital that is appropriate for their care, 
regardless of COVID-19 status. 
- 
The previous 5 days should be interpreted with caution. Case counts during this timeframe may rise as 
individuals are identified and tested and as tests are processed

Notes: 
- 
* Hospitalizations for individuals missing age are excluded from the analysis (counts, crude rates, age-
adjusted rates, risk reduction) 
- 
** = Denotes reference category. All risks are presented in comparison to the reference category. 
Comparisons are made by dividing the age-specific rates in the age category of interest to the age-specific 
rates in the reference category 
- 
To more accurately estimate vaccine coverage in Nova Scotia, the province is switching from using 
Statistics Canada population estimates to the number of Nova Scotians eligible for MSI (the province’s 
health insurance card) as the denominator for estimating both per capita rates and vaccine coverage.

- 
A person is considered unvaccinated when they have zero doses of any COVID-19 vaccine 
- 
A person is considered to have two doses 14 or more days after the second dose of any vaccine OR 14 or 
more days after one dose of Johnson & Johnson vaccine OR are within 14 days of receiving a third dose of 
any COVID-19 vaccine 
- 
A person is considered to have three or more doses 14 or more days after a third dose of any COVID-19 
vaccine 
- 
Due to small number of events occurring among those just one dose, that group is not included in this 
analysis.
