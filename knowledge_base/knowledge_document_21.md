Nova Scotia Monthly COVID-19 Epidemiologic Summary: 
January 10, 2023 
Public Health Branch 
Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Highlights: 
 
 
• 
A total of 3,014 PCR positive results, 165 hospitalizations and 11 deaths from COVID-19 were observed during the month 
of December 2022.  
 
• 
The number of PCR positive results, hospitalizations increased while deaths decreased in December compared to 
November. 
 
• 
Of the 11 deaths that occurred in December, 91% (10) were in people aged 70 years and older and 36% (4) were in people 
residing in a long-term care facility.  
 
• 
Age and lack of vaccination continue to be associated with severe outcomes:  
 
• 
Nova Scotians aged 70+ have been hospitalized at almost 19 times the rate of those 18-49 years of age and their 
rate of death is 280 times higher compared to those under 50 years of age.  
 
• 
Unvaccinated Nova Scotians were hospitalized and died at almost three times the rate as those with three or 
more doses (hospitalized = 2.7; died=2.5)

collection date, March 1st to December 31st, 2022 (N=92,517) 
 
 
Data source: PPHLN 
 
Notes:  
- 
Laboratory tests are also referred to as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests 
- 
Access to PCR tests are restricted to eligible populations as outlined in the following link:

regardless of COVID-19 status.

ICU and Hospitalization are subject to lag. Newly reported captures outcomes outside the reporting period.

* Hospitalizations for individuals missing age are excluded from the analysis (counts, crude rates, age-
adjusted rates, risk reduction)

** = Denotes reference category. All risks are presented in comparison to the reference category. 
Comparisons are made by dividing the age-specific rates in the age category of interest to the age-specific 
rates in the reference category 
- 
To more accurately estimate vaccine coverage in Nova Scotia, the province is switching from using 
Statistics Canada population estimates to the number of Nova Scotians eligible for MSI (the province’s 
health insurance card) as the denominator for estimating both per capita rates and vaccine coverage.

- 
A person is considered unvaccinated when they have zero doses of any COVID-19 vaccine 
- 
A person is considered to have two doses 14 or more days after the second dose of any vaccine OR 14 or 
more days after one dose of Johnson & Johnson vaccine OR are within 14 days of receiving a third dose of 
any COVID-19 vaccine 
- 
A person is considered to have three or more doses 14 or more days after a third dose of any COVID-19 
vaccine 
- 
Due to small number of events occurring among those just one dose, that group is not included in this 
analysis.
