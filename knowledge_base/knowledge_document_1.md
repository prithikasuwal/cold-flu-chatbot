Nova Scotia Weekly COVID-19 Epidemiologic Summary: 
30 March 2022, 17:00 
 
Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health 
Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness 
Highlights: 
 
• 
An additional 4,188 PCR positive results, 10 deaths, and 43 hospitalizations were reported this 
week (March 23-March 29).  
 
• 
The number of PCR positive results have continued to increase over the past three weeks.  
 
• 
About half of the PCR positive tests this week were confirmatory tests on individuals who 
tested positive on rapid antigen tests. These individuals would not have been eligible for a PCR 
test between December 27, 2021, and February 23, 2022. 
 
• 
There was an increase in the number of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 this week (43) 
compared to last week (30). 
 
• 
Deaths have been decreasing in the previous three weeks. There were 10 deaths reported this 
week and 13 reported last week. 
 
• 
Individuals aged 65 years or older continue to have the highest rates of hospitalization and 
death.  
 
• 
Vaccination continues to significantly reduce the risk of hospitalization and death. 
 
• 
The percentage of COVID-19 cases that have been hospitalized are lower in Wave 5 (1.5%) 
compared to previous waves, particularly the first wave (5.3%) when vaccines were not yet 
available. The percentage of COVID-19 cases that resulted in death are also lower in Wave 5 
(0.3%) compared the first wave (5.9%).  
 
• 
For Wave 5, the case fatality rate (% who died) among long-term care residents (2.4%) has been 
substantially lower compared to all other waves, particularly the first wave (21.7%).

collection date (N=50,847) 
 
 
 
Data source: PPHLN 
*Notes:  
- 
Laboratory tests are also referred to as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests 
- 
RAT means rapid antigen test 
- 
The three-day period presented in the red area should be interpreted with caution. PCR positive results 
during this timeframe may rise as labs continue to be processed 
- 
Two changes to PCR eligibility were made during Wave 5: On December 27, 2021, PCR testing was limited to 
certain priority groups, including those at highest risk of severe disease, people living in long-term care, and 
health-care workers (outlined as groups 1-3 in the following link: 
https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirustesting). On February 24, 2022, PCR testing eligibility was expanded to 
include confirmatory testing for anyone who tested positive on a rapid test (group 4 in the link above).

Figure 2: Number of COVID-19 cases and seven-day moving average of cases 
linked to open long-term care and residential care facility outbreaks (N=684) 
 
 
 
Data source: Panorama 
*Notes: 
- 
Only open (ongoing) confirmed outbreaks are included 
- 
A confirmed outbreak is defined as two or more lab-confirmed cases in residents and/or staff within a 14-
day period AND an epidemiological link between cases AND at least one reported case could have acquired 
the infection in the facility 
- 
Only facilities that are designated as long-term care congregate settings are included; it excludes residential 
care facilities and disability support program facilities with 12 or fewer residents 
- 
Includes confirmed and probable cases entered into Panorama and linked to the outbreak 
- 
Episode date is recorded as the date of symptom onset. If that information is unavailable, the following is 
used (in hierarchical order): specimen collection date, lab result date clinical diagnosis date  
- 
The five-day period presented in the red area should be interpreted with caution. Case counts during this 
timeframe may rise as individuals are identified and tested; as tests are processed; as data is inputted into 
Panorama
