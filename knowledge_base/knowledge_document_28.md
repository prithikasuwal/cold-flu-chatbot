Nova Scotia Monthly COVID-19 Epidemiologic Summary: 
10AUG2023 
Public Health Branch 
Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Highlights: 
 
• 
There were 260 PCR positives, 35 hospitalizations and 0 deaths from COVID-19 during the month of July 
2023.  
 
• 
The number of COVID-19 PCR positive results, hospitalizations and deaths decreased in July 2023 
compared to June 2023.  
 
• 
Age and under-vaccination continue to be associated with severe outcomes:  
 
• 
Nova Scotians aged 70+ are 30 times more likely to have been hospitalized compared to those aged 
18-49 years and are 22 times more likely to die compared to those aged 50-69 years.  
 
• 
Nova Scotians who were unvaccinated or had not completed their primary series were hospitalized 
and died at approximately two times the rate (1.7 and 2.1, respectively) as those who received a 
booster within 168 days.

COVID-19 Cases  
Figure 1: Number and seven-day moving average of PCR positive results by 
collection date, 1 July 2022 to 31 July 2023 (N=39,261) 
 
Data source: PPHLN 
Notes:  
- 
Laboratory tests are also referred to as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests. 
- 
Access to PCR tests is restricted to eligible populations as outlined in the following link: 
https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirustesting. 
- 
Only the first instance of a PCR positive test within a 90-day period is counted for each individual. Multiple 
positive tests within a 90-day period are considered the same infection. A PCR positive test 90-days or more 
from the date of the initial positive test are counted as a new infection. 
- 
Previously Reported refers to PCR positives that were included in previous COVID-19 monthly reports. 
- 
Reporting Period refers to new PCR positives that occurred within the current monthly reporting period.  
- 
New refers to PCR positives that occurred prior to the current monthly reporting period but were not 
included in prior reports due to lags in notification.

professionals/national-case-definition.html 
COVID-19 Hospitalization Definitions 
Hospitalization: A person admitted to hospital with a positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2 within 21 days of admission, or up 
to 3 days post-admission and with no epidemiologic link to the hospital (i.e., excluding nosocomial infection), and 
excluding specialized service unrelated to COVID-19 (e.g., surgery, obstetrics, etc).  
 
ICU: A person admitted for at least 24 hours to the ICU and with a positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2 within 21 days prior 
to ICU admission or anytime after hospital admission.
