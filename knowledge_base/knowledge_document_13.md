Nova Scotia Weekly COVID-19 Epidemiologic Summary: 
21 June 2022 
 
Public Health Branch 
Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness 
Highlights: 
 
• 
An additional 1,420 PCR positive results, 37 hospitalizations and 7 deaths from COVID-19 were reported during the 
seven-day period ending June 20.  
 
• 
The number of lab-confirmed cases reported this week were lower than last week. Cases linked to long-term 
care/residential facilities, and deaths have declined in recent weeks. There was an increase in hospitalizations this 
week. 
 
• 
Of the 7 deaths reported this week, all were in people aged 70 years and older and 43% were in people who resided in 
long-term care facilities.  
 
• 
Age continues to be associated with severe outcomes:  
 
• 
The risk of hospitalization is 11 times higher for those aged 70 years and older compared to those 18 to 49 
years old. 
 
• 
The risk of death is approximately 115 times higher for those aged 70 years and older compared to those 
younger than 50. 
 
• 
Staying up to date with vaccinations – that is, getting all the doses available for your age group and health status, 
including boosters -- offers significant protection against severe outcomes. 
• 
Those who received three or more doses of COVID-19 vaccine had an 89.2% lower risk of hospitalization 
and a 93.1% lower risk of death than those who were unvaccinated or had only one dose.  
• 
When adjusted for age, those unvaccinated or with only one dose have 8.5 times the rate of death 
compared to those with two doses and 14.5 times the rate of death compared to those with three or more 
doses.  
• 
Unvaccinated persons between 50-69 years of age have 5.2 times more risk of hospitalization and 13.9 
times more risk of death than those with three or more doses.  
• 
Unvaccinated persons over 70 years of age have 12.3 times more risk of hospitalization and 15.3 times 
more risk of death than those with three or more doses.  
• 
The proportion of people with confirmed COVID-19 infections who experience severe outcomes (hospitalization and 
death) continues to be relatively low during the Omicron waves compared to earlier waves. Since March 1, 2022 
(Wave 6 to date), 1.5% of cases were hospitalized and 0.3% of cases have died. 
 
• 
The total number of COVID-19 cases in residents of long-term care facilities is higher in the Omicron waves than in 
previous waves, with three times as many cases in Wave 6 than were reported in Wave 5. The overall fatality rate 
remains relatively low in the Omicron waves particularly compared to Wave 1.

Figure 1: Number and seven-day moving average of PCR positive results by 
collection date, February 15 to June 21, 2022 (N=62,219) 
 
 
Data source: Provincial Public Health Lab Network 
 
Notes:  
- 
PCR refers to polymerase chain reaction tests performed in a lab 
- 
The previous 3 days presented in the red area should be interpreted with caution. PCR positive results during 
this timeframe may rise as labs continue to be processed 
- 
Only the first positive result for the same individual within a 90-day period are counted; subsequent positive 
results will constitute a new infection (i.e., a re-infection).  
- 
Access to PCR tests are restricted to eligible populations as outlined in the following link: 
https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirustesting. 
- 
Eligibility has changed over time. Before February 24, 2022, confirmatory PCR testing for people who tested 
positive on a rapid test was not available.

Figure 2: Number of COVID-19 cases and seven-day moving average of cases 
linked to open long-term care and residential care facility outbreaks, February 
15 to June 21, 2022 (N=477) 
 
 
 
Data source: Panorama 
Notes: 
- 
Only open (ongoing) confirmed outbreaks are included 
- 
A confirmed outbreak is defined as two or more lab-confirmed cases in residents and/or staff within a 14-
day period AND an epidemiological link between cases AND at least one reported case could have acquired 
the infection in the facility 
- 
Only facilities that are designated as long-term care congregate settings are included; it excludes residential 
care facilities and disability support program facilities with 12 or fewer residents 
- 
Includes confirmed and probable cases entered into Panorama and linked to the outbreak 
- 
Episode date is recorded as the date of symptom onset. If that information is unavailable, the following is 
used (in hierarchical order): specimen collection date, lab result date clinical diagnosis date  
- 
The five-day period presented in the red area should be interpreted with caution. Case counts during this 
timeframe may rise as individuals are identified and tested; as tests are processed; as data are inputted into 
Panorama
