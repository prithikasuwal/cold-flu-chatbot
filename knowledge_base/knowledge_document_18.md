Nova Scotia Monthly COVID-19 Epidemiologic Summary: 
October 11, 2022 
Public Health Branch 
Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Highlights: 
 
 
• 
A total of 4,664 PCR positive results, 205 hospitalizations and 14 deaths from COVID-19 were observed during the month 
of September 2022.  
 
• 
The number of PCR positive results, hospitalizations and deaths decreased in September compared to August.  
 
• 
Of the 14 deaths that occurred in September, 93% (13) were in people aged 70 years and older and 50% (7) were in people 
residing in a long-term care facility.  
 
• 
Age and lack of vaccination continue to be associated with severe outcomes:  
 
• 
Nova Scotians aged 70+ have been hospitalized at almost 17 times the rate of those 18-49 years of age and their 
rate of death is 181 higher compared to those under 50 years of age.  
 
• 
Unvaccinated Nova Scotians were hospitalized at almost three times (2.8) the rate and died at three times (3.0) 
times the rate as those with three or more doses.

collection date, March 1st to September 30, 2022 (N=82,078)
 
Data source: PPHLN 
Notes:  
- 
Laboratory tests are also referred to as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests 
- 
Access to PCR tests are restricted to eligible populations as outlined in the following link: 
https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirustesting. 
- 
Due to lag in reporting, some PRC positives will be outside the reporting period (newly reported) 
 
*All individuals admitted to the hospital continue to be tested regardless of symptoms.

regardless of COVID-19 status. 
- 
ICU and Hospitalization are subject to lag. Newly reported captures outcomes outside the reporting period.

- 
* Hospitalizations for individuals missing age are excluded from the analysis (counts, crude rates, age-
adjusted rates, risk reduction)

** = Denotes reference category. All risks are presented in comparison to the reference category. 
Comparisons are made by dividing the age-specific rates in the age category of interest to the age-specific 
rates in the reference category 
- 
To more accurately estimate vaccine coverage in Nova Scotia, the province is switching from using 
Statistics Canada population estimates to the number of Nova Scotians eligible for MSI (the province’s 
health insurance card) as the denominator for estimating both per capita rates and vaccine coverage.

adjusted rates, risk reduction) 
- 
A person is considered unvaccinated when they have zero doses of any COVID-19 vaccine 
- 
A person is considered to have two doses 14 or more days after the second dose of any vaccine OR 14 or 
more days after one dose of Johnson & Johnson vaccine OR are within 14 days of receiving a third dose of 
any COVID-19 vaccine 
- 
A person is considered to have three or more doses 14 or more days after a third dose of any COVID-19 
vaccine 
- 
Due to small number of events occurring among those just one dose, that group is not included in this 
analysis. 
-
