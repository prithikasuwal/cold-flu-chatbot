Nova Scotia Weekly COVID-19 Epidemiologic Summary: 
24 May 2022, 17:00 
 
Public Health Branch 
Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness 
Highlights: 
 
 
• 
An additional 1,584 PCR positive results, 40 hospitalizations and 13 deaths from COVID-19 
were reported during the seven-day period ending May 23.  
 
• 
The number of lab-confirmed cases, cases linked to long-term care and residential care facility 
outbreaks and hospitalizations continue to decline from their peak in mid-April. These declines 
suggest we have passed the peak of Wave 6. 
 
• 
Of the 13 deaths reported this week, 85% were in people aged 70+ and 54% were in people 
who resided in long-term care facilities.  
 
• 
Age continues to be associated with severe outcomes:  
 
• 
The risk of hospitalization is nearly 11 times higher for those aged 70 years and older 
compared to those 18 to 49 years old. 
 
• 
The risk of death is approximately 111 times higher for those aged 70 years and older 
compared to those younger than 50. 
 
• 
Staying up to date with vaccinations – that is, getting all the doses available for your age 
group and health status, including boosters -- offers significant protection against severe 
outcomes. 
• 
Those who received 3 or more doses of COVID-19 vaccine had an 85.7% lower risk of 
hospitalization and a 95.2% lower risk of death than those who were unvaccinated or 
had only one dose.  
• 
When adjusted for age, people with only two doses of vaccine have nearly twice the 
rate of death than those with three or more doses. Those unvaccinated or with only 
one dose have 12 times the rate of death compared to those with three of more 
doses. 
• 
The proportion of people with confirmed COVID-19 infections who experience severe 
outcomes (hospitalization and death) continues to be relatively low during the Omicron waves 
compared to earlier waves. Since March 1, 2022 (Wave 6 to date), 1.3% of cases were 
hospitalized and 0.3% of cases have died. 
 
• 
The total number of COVID-19 cases in residents of long-term care facilities is higher in the 
Omicron waves than in previous waves, with 2.7 times as many cases in Wave 6 than were 
reported in Wave 5. However, the overall fatality rate remains relatively low in the Omicron 
waves particularly compared to Wave 1.

*Notes:  
- 
Laboratory tests are also referred to as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests 
- 
The previous 3 days presented in the red area should be interpreted with caution. PCR positive results during 
this timeframe may rise as labs continue to be processed 
- 
Access to PCR tests are restricted to eligible populations as outlined in the following link: 
https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirustesting. 
- 
Eligibility has changed over time. Before February 24, 2022, confirmatory PCR testing for people who tested 
positive on a rapid test was not available.

linked to open long-term care and residential care facility outbreaks, 15 Feb to 
24 May 2022 (N=1,971) 
 
 
Data source: Panorama 
*Notes: 
- 
Only open (ongoing) confirmed outbreaks are included 
- 
A confirmed outbreak is defined as two or more lab-confirmed cases in residents and/or staff within a 14-
day period AND an epidemiological link between cases AND at least one reported case could have acquired 
the infection in the facility 
- 
Only facilities that are designated as long-term care congregate settings are included; it excludes residential 
care facilities or disability support program facilities with 12 or fewer residents and private living facilities 
not licensed by the Department of Seniors and Long Term Care. 
- 
Includes confirmed and probable cases entered into Panorama and linked to the outbreak 
- 
Episode date is recorded as the date of symptom onset. If that information is unavailable, the following is 
used (in hierarchical order): specimen collection date, lab result date clinical diagnosis date  
- 
The five-day period presented in the red area should be interpreted with caution. Case counts during this 
timeframe may rise as individuals are identified and tested; as tests are processed; as data is inputted into 
Panorama
